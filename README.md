# HOMEWORK #3: GUI Practice

## Laboratory Work #3: GUI Practice
It’s time to practice your GUI application programming. Enhance the Grade Calculator by turning it into Milestone Calculator. You need to write a GUI-based application that will compute the grades for your milestones and terminal assessment according to the given grade and distribution.
Assume that each milestone has the following distribution to make up 100%:
- Milestone 1: 25%
- Milestone 2: 40%
- Terminal Assessment: 35%

This means that your maximum grade for Milestone 1 should be 25 points; Milestone 2 should be 40 points, and Terminal Assessment should be 35 points. Your program must not accept values lower than 0 and higher than the maximum points per Milestone. Should these exceptions occur, your program must be able to handle them by prompting a dialog box indicating the exception.

Make sure that your program is modularized by drafting your class diagrams for this activity. You may use any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that you are comfortable with in writing your codes.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The course was designed based on the assumption that you are willing to work with a group. However, if at any point in the course, you realize that you’re more comfortable working on your own, you may opt to work on the output/activity individually; just make sure to let your mentor know so he/she can take note of it. Whichever set-up you choose will not have any impact on your grade.

## Cloning and Running the Java Application in IntelliJ
This is a step-by-step guide on how to clone and run my Java application in IntelliJ.

## Prerequisites
Before you can clone and run the Java application, you need to have the following installed:
- Git
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
- JDK version 17.0.6

## Cloning the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the repository.
3. Type the following command to clone the repository:<br/>
```git clone https://github.com/hnsnl15/gui_laboratory_3.git```
4. Once the repository is cloned, open IntelliJ IDEA and select File > Open.
5. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the root directory of the project.

## Running the Application
- Open the Calculator class of the project.
- Click the green arrow icon in the left margin of the editor, or right-click the file and select Run Main.main().
- IntelliJ IDEA will compile and run the application.
- That's it! You should now have my Java application running in IntelliJ IDEA.
